We have to slect the model for our Dataset, so we are applying all Regression Models on ours Datasets and then selecting best regression model for our dataset on basis of r_squared co-efficient. The best model will have r_squared co-efficient closest to one.

Data.csv is the dataset for model selection. This dataset is cleaned and numeric, so we don't have to pre-process it.

The r_squared co-efficients of All Regression Models are given below:

Multiple Linear Regression:  0.9325315554761303
Polynomial Regression:       0.9458193330952832
Support Vector Regression:   0.9480784049986258
Decision Tree Regression:    0.922905874177941
Random Forest Regression:    0.9615908334363876

Hence, according to r_squared co-efficent: Random Forest Regression is best regression model for this dataset Data.csv.
