# Classification Model Selection for Dataset

We have to select the best classification model for our dataset, so we are analyzing all models by applying all classification models on our dataset and then selecting the best classification model based on the accuracy score. The best model will have an accuracy closest to one.

`Data.csv` is the dataset for model selection. This dataset is cleaned and numeric, so we don't have to pre-process it.

The accuracy scores of all classification models are given below:

- **Logistic Regression:** 0.9473684210526315
- **Linear SVM:** 0.9415204678362573
- **Kernel SVM:** 0.9473684210526315
- **KNN Classification:** 0.9473684210526315
- **Naive Bayes Classification:** 0.9415204678362573
- **Decision Tree Classification:** 0.9590643274853801
- **Random Forest Classification:** 0.9473684210526315

Hence, according to the accuracy score, **Decision Tree Classification** is the best classification model for this dataset.
